            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Kofi Asiamah Darko-Mensah, a dedicated backend web developer currently thriving in the vibrant tech
                landscape of Accra, Ghana. My core passion lies in architecting and building robust, scalable APIsâ€”the
                digital infrastructure that powers modern applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional journey officially took flight after I successfully completed my Bachelor's in Computer
                Application at Parul University. This academic experience provided me with a crucial, comprehensive
                understanding of software development principles, data structures, and the logic that underpins all
                computing. It was during this time that I discovered my affinity for the server-side, appreciating the
                power and challenge of designing systems that are efficient, secure, and reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fundamentally, I operate under the belief that consistent effort is the truest path to mastery and
                learning new things. The world of backend development, with its constantly evolving frameworks, security
                protocols, and cloud technologies, demands continuous learning. I embrace this necessity, always seeking
                out new tools and best practices to push the boundaries of what I can deliver. My goal is to build not
                just functional code, but exceptional digital foundations </p>
